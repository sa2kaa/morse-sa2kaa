		History of the "Morse Classic" trainer

Eric S. Raymind <esr@thyrsus.com>, November 2012 (release 2.5):
    Code audited with cppcheck, warnings fixed up.
    Declare a public repository and Ohloh page in the control file.

Neale Pickett <neale@woozle.org>, June 2011 (release 2.4):
    Add beep for ALSA

Thomas Horsten <thomas@horsten.com>, November 2010 (release 2.3):
    Fixed the -A, -B, and -S options (-B was always active, -A and -S
    had no effect).
    Only include prosigns if -B is specified, per the documentation.
    Added '@' character (.--.-.), in use if -B is enabled.
    Changed representation of <SN> prosign from '@' to '~' to accommodate '@'.
    Don't crash if char is signed and a negative value is sent.

Thomas Horsten <thomas@horsten.com>, October 2010 (release 2.2):
    Add beep for PulseAudio.

Jay Maynard (K5ZC) <jmaynard@conmicro.com>, January 2005 (release 2.1):
    Mac OS X port patches.

Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>, January 2005 (release 2.0):
    Accepted maintainer's baton from Joe Dellinger and Paul J. Drongowski.
    Dusted it off, cleaned it up to modern C standards. 
    Changed ALLINTERNATIONAL to runtime -A option.
    Changed ALLPROSIGNS to runtime -S option.
    Changed ALLPUNCTUATION to runtime -B option.
    Changed ERROR_FREQUENCY to runtime -x option.
    Changed ERROR_VOLUME to runtime -X option.
    Dropped BSD signal and tty support, it's all POSIX now.
    QSO assumes that srand48/lrand48 is available, so morse will too.
    Wrote the manual page.
    Updated all code to use ANSI prototypes.
    Named it "Morse Classic" in recognition of its ancient BSD-Reno roots and
    to distinguish it from Alan Cox's morse program.

Jacek M. Holeczek <holeczek@us.edu.pl>, March/April 2000:
    Fixed some source code files so that no warnings from -Wall appear.
    The character set made compatible with the International Morse Code.
    Added the -n NUM, -R NUM, -N NUM, -C 'STRING', -q options.
    Added beep for the AdLib/SoundBlaster FM chip and for the Open Sound
    System (OSS) /dev/dsp device.
    Note: The code uses directly ANSI sequences "\E[7m" to turn the inverse
          video mode on and "\E[0m" to turn all video attributes off.
          One should rewrite the openterminal function to provide the
          enter_standout_mode "smso/so" and exit_standout_mode "rmso/se"
          terminfo/termcap terminal string capabilities.

Joe Dellinger <joe@sep.stanford.edu>, November 1994:
    Fixed a bug in the USG termio calls.
    Added an option to make the "error" beep come out via the beep
    routines instead of by printing a control-G.

Joe Dellinger <joe@sep.stanford.edu>, April 1994:
    Finally got around to getting my license: WH6UR

Marc Unangst (N8VRH), <mju@mudos.ann-arbor.mi.us>, December 1992:
    Added System V support.

The program was originally written by Joe Dellinger at the Hawaii
Institute of Geophysics (but he moved to Oklahoma in July 1994).

  * First alpha on Tue Aug 11 14:01:02 HST 1992
  * Second alpha Thu Nov 26 03:24:19 HST 1992
  * submitted to comp.sources.misc Dec 15 1993
  * Revised version submitted to comp.sources.misc Nov 22 1994

Joe had this to say about the origin of the program:

   This code is (ridiculously) heavily modified from morse.c from the Reno 
   UNIX distribution. I (Joe) also used slightly modified versions of a 
   subroutine from Richard Ottolini at Unocal for Sun workstation tone 
   generation.  Scott Seligman at Stanford added support for other sorts 
   of devices and made several other changes. John Shalamskas helped test 
   and made comments.

(Note that Sun support and the beeper code for most of these odd devices 
was long obsolete and has been removed.)
