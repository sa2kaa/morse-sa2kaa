This is Morse Classic, a generic morse-code practice utility for Unix systems.
You'll invoke it as "morse"; the full name is to distinguish it from Alan
Cox's "morse" program.

Currently supported devices:
 X11:    The X11 window system. (Warning: not all X11 implementations handle
         duration and frequency of beeps properly!)
 Linux:  The IBM PC console speaker.
 OSS:    Open Sound System /dev/dsp device.  Also works with the newer 
         ALSA Linux sound system using the legacy OSS device.
 PA:     PulseAudio using the pulse-simple client API.
 ALSA:   ALSA Linux sound system /dev/snd/* device.

Adding a new device is as simple as creating a new implementation of the
beep.h interface. See beep*.[ch] for examples and documentation.
Please send any additions to the maintainers.

A modified version of the program "QSO" by Paul J. Drongowski is also included.
